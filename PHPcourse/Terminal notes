Terminal notes

dir - - from MS dos, directory - tells where computer is reading from - in general, home to begin with

cd - go to a location
cd lampp/ - go to lampp - 

cd / -- tells computer to go to root directory

cd .. -- tells computer to go back one step - go one level above

cd /home -- go to home directory

ls  - lists directory
pwd -- tells you where you are - what directory you're in, full pathway

cp source path/filename (then) target folder- ex: sudo cp /Documents/2022/PHPcourse/firsttry.php /opt/lampp/htdocs/tests/
NOTE- in above example i need sudo commmand bc my target folder is in restricted area (root) - needs password

sudo - instruction that says for this command you are root

cd ~ -- goes to home
cd / -- goes back completely to computer

gedit -- stands for gnome edit - looks like - text editor

gedit info.php -- to open file using gedit, type gedit and name of file - if already in the folder that contains that file, or type file path

In order to access restricted files - use sudo - BE CAREFUL

/opt/lampp/logs/php_error_log -- this is where the php log errors are found

If you open a restricted php file *for instance - in gedit without putting sudo, it will open the file in read-only. If you modify the file, it won't let you save changes - you don't have permission.


cp Documents/2022/PHPcourse/access.php D - this copied the file access.php and pasted it in the home folder, and named the text doc D :)
